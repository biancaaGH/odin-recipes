    <h2>Best Ever Irish Soda Bread</h2>
    <p>A moist, cake-like Irish Soda Bread that's not just for St. Paddy's Day... it's so easy and sooo delicious you'll be craving it all year 'round.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan.
        </li>
        <li>Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter gently into the flour mixture until well combined, and stir in the raisins. In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk and eggs together; lightly beat the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture. Place the dough into the prepared cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the bread has risen and the top is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. A knife inserted into the center of the bread should come out clean. Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing. Serve warm.</li>
